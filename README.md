# Overview  
The provided code simulates a distributed network built on a hypercube topology, enhanced with modern cryptographic techniques:

- **SuperAPI nodes**: Create transactions  
- **Validator nodes**: Verify and approve transactions  

Cryptographic methods used include symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption, digital signatures, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

## Dependencies  
- **Python standard library**  
  - `random`  
  - `time`, `datetime`  
  - `os` (for generating random bytes)  
- **Crypto libraries**  
  - `Crypto` (AES/GCM encryption utilities)  
  - `cryptography` (RSA key generation, hashing, padding, serialization)  
- **JWT handling**  
  - `jwt`  
- **Custom modules**  
  - `hypercubenode`  
  - `aes_gcm`  
  - `superapi`  
  - `validator`

## Main Components

### Hypercube Node  
`HypercubeNode` is the base class for both SuperAPI and Validator nodes. Each node:  
- Has a unique identifier  
- Knows its neighbors in an _n_-dimensional hypercube  
- Communicates across the topology as defined by the cube’s dimensions  

### SuperAPI  
A specialized node that:  
- Generates transactions  
- Packages each transaction with sender, recipient, amount, and cryptographic payloads (encrypted data, signatures, JWTs)  

### Validator  
Responsible for:  
- Verifying integrity and authenticity of incoming transactions  
- Approving or rejecting based on cryptographic checks  

### AES‑GCM  
The `AESGCM` class provides:  
- **Encryption**: AES in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)  
- **Authentication**: Built‑in data integrity checks

## Flow of the Program  
1. **Key Generation**  
   - Symmetric keys (AES)  
   - Asymmetric key pairs (RSA)  
2. **Node Instantiation**  
   - Create multiple SuperAPI and Validator nodes across hypercube zones  
3. **Transaction Creation**  
   - SuperAPI nodes generate random transactions  
4. **Transaction Validation**  
   - Validator nodes verify each transaction’s cryptographic proofs  
5. **Performance Measurement**  
   - Record and display total processing time  

---

## Cryptographic Techniques Used  
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**  
  - Encrypts transaction payloads  
- **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**  
  - Creates digital signatures for authenticity  
- **SHA‑512**  
  - Generates unique hashes for transactions and blocks  
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**  
  - Authenticates transaction senders

## Notes  
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before running.  
- This code is a **proof of concept**; further optimizations may be needed for production use.
