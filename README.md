Overview
The provided code demonstrates a simulation of a distributed network using a hypercube topology combined with cryptographic techniques. The main components in this system are SuperAPI nodes and Validator nodes. SuperAPI nodes are responsible for creating transactions, while Validator nodes verify and approve them.

The code also incorporates various cryptographic techniques such as symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption, digital signatures, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

Dependencies
Python's random module.
Crypto library for symmetric encryption (AES) and utilities.
cryptography library for RSA, hashing, padding, serialization, and more.
jwt library for handling JSON Web Tokens.
time and datetime for time-related operations.
os for generating random bytes.
Custom modules: hypercubenode, aes_gcm, superapi, and validator.
Main Components
Hypercube Node
HypercubeNode acts as the parent class for both SuperAPI and Validator nodes. Each node in the hypercube is identified by a unique ID and can communicate with its neighbors. The structure of the hypercube is determined by the given dimensions.

SuperAPI
This is a specialized type of node responsible for generating transactions. Each transaction contains details like sender, recipient, amount, and additional cryptographic attributes like encrypted data, digital signatures, and JWTs.

Validator
Validator nodes verify and approve the transactions created by SuperAPI nodes. They ensure the integrity and authenticity of each transaction using cryptographic techniques.

AES-GCM
The AESGCM class provides functionality for encrypting and decrypting data using the AES algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). This mode provides both encryption and message authentication.

Flow of the Program
Keys for encryption and signatures are generated and stored.
A number of SuperAPI and Validator nodes are instantiated in different zones of the hypercube.
Transactions are randomly generated by SuperAPI nodes.
Transactions are approved by Validator nodes.
The program measures and displays the time taken to process all transactions.
Cryptographic Techniques Used
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): Used for encrypting the transaction data.

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): Used for digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of transaction data.

SHA512: Used as the hashing algorithm for generating unique transaction and block hashes.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for authentication. Each transaction contains a JWT to authenticate the sender.
